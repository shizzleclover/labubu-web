# 🧸 Product Overview – Labubu Showroom

## 1. Product Name
**Labubu Showroom**

---

## 2. Product Vision

Labubu Showroom is a digital showroom and collector platform for designer toys, especially Labubu and Pop Mart-style figures. It enables users to upload, organize, and publicly display their personal collections in a premium, minimalist gallery interface.

While inspired by NFT marketplaces in aesthetic and layout, Labubu Showroom is **non-crypto-based** and monetized through **monthly subscriptions**. The goal is to provide collectors a personal, shareable space to showcase their collections and be part of a curated community.
